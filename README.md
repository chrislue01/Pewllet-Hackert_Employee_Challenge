# Pewllet-Hackert_Employee_Challenge

Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
Using SQL- relational databases

Purpose of our project
The purpose of our project is to determine the number of retiring employees by title and identify which employees are eligible to to participate in the mentorship program. Our retiring employees are born between January, 1 1952 and December, 31 1955. 

The Results
With the retirment_titles table we are able to see every eligible for retirement employee and how long they have worked at each position over the course of their career.

The table that we created is shows the most recent title for employees of retirment age.

Our retiring_titles shows us the a majority of the employees of retirment age (64%) are seniors.

Conclusion
Seeing most of the workforce is either retirment or mentorship eligible there will most likely be many positions to fill over coming years.
